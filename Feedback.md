# Constructive Feedback

Updated: 02/13/19

## Suggestions

- Communication: Instead of giving us an overview perspective on an assignment, maybe try going into further detail with some example code. This was best relayed when going over gcc and the developer options.

- Creativity:  Have you thought about trying to dedicate a class or lab time to aid groups in some flaws that may be occurring within their code? The code reviews we have are a really good idea, but we do not seem to have enough time to develop solutions to current problems or maybe future problems that you might be able to foresee.

## Successes

- Engaging: The simple fact that you do not use slides to follow for lecture makes your presentation of the material much more engaging and interactive. This unique style of teaching is probably my favorite, because it holds my interest for a long while.

- Code review: You do not force one particular method on our class to use; but also, seem to be intrigued when learning about something new within each of our compiler constructions. This is gratifying, because your criticism isn't bias or degrading.

- Language freedom: Allowing us to choose our implementation language is extremely helpful, and has helped two of our group members learn Python.
